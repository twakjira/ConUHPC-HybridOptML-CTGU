ConUHPC-HybridOptML-CTGU
Overview

ConUHPC-HybridOptML-CTGU is a Python-based application designed to predict the peak and ultimate stress-strain responses of confined Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC). This tool is particularly useful for researchers and engineers in the field of civil engineering, providing a quick and efficient way to model UHPC structures.
Features

    User-friendly GUI created with PySimpleGUI.
    Predictions for peak stress, peak strain, ultimate stress, and ultimate strain of confined UHPC.
    Input parameters include the shape of the structure, transverse reinforcement ratio, yield strength of transverse reinforcement, compressive strength of unconfined UHPC, fiber volumetric ratio, and effective confinement.
    Data visualization for stress-strain responses.

Installation

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Install required packages: PySimpleGUI, pandas, numpy, PIL, and webbrowser.
    Download and extract the application files to a directory on your computer.

Usage

    Run the main script to open the application interface.
    Enter the required parameters in the respective fields.
    Click 'Predict' to view the predicted stress-strain responses.
    The results, including peak stress and strain, ultimate stress and strain, will be displayed in the output section.

Data Files

    comb_data_ecc_USED.xlsx
    comb_data_ecu_USED.xlsx
    comb_data_fcc_USED.xlsx
    comb_data_fcu_USED.xlsx

These files contain the necessary data for the model to function correctly. Ensure they are located in the same directory as the script.
Images

    stress_strain.png, image2.png, image4.png: These images are used within the GUI for illustration and instruction purposes.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    Libraries: PySimpleGUI, pandas, numpy, pickle, PIL, webbrowser
